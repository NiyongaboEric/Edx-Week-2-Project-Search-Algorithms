remember the following in order to Execute Puzzle Game successful

1. you must have python3 version installed

2. the output are saved in "output.txt" file.

3. we are solving 3 types of algorithm in Graph theory 
	. Depth-First Search(dfs)
	. Breadth-First Search(bfs)
	. A Star Algorithm(ast)

4. check if initial state is solvable and are 9 numbers(0, ...8) ?

5. by default goal sate is [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], feel free to change if neccessary

6. zero number represent empty space in game.

7. how to run code, open your CMD or terminal, type/choose the algorithm you are interested.
	
	Example: dfs
	python driver_3.py dfs 1,2,5,3,4,0,6,7,8

	Example: bfs
	python driver_3.py bfs 1,2,5,3,4,0,6,7,8

	Example: ast
	python driver_3.py ast 1,2,5,3,4,0,6,7,8
